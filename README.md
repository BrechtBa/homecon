KNXControl
==========

Control your home KNX instalation using state of the art control algorithms and visualise the results

In search for an affordable way to visually control my home automation KNX installation using tablets and smartphones I came acros the combination of SmartHome.py and SmartVisu. Very soon however I wanted to extend the functionality beyond their standard features to include Alarms, Permanent data monitoring and User permissions.
The current project serves as a framework on top of SmartHome.py, with predefined item structures and logics. It also contains a visualisation with similar looks as SmartVisu but a very different set-up.

The goal of the project is to have an open source, user friendly control system for a domestic building, including a Model Predictive Control algorithm to control shading, heating and ventilation based on weather and energy price predictions should energy prices become variable in the near future.

 
The following steps will take you through the installation and configuration of KNXControl.
