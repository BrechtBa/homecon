HomeConn
==========

Control your home instalation using state of the art control algorithms and visualise the results

HomeConn is intended to have the conn over the entire energy management of your house and direct it in the best possible way.
Not only HomeConn has the conn but you do. As the software is entirely local (no information gets sent from your home to the web) you can rest assured that your privacy is respected.
This in contrast to "Smart Thermostats" available on the market (ala Google NEST) which gather information about you.
HomeConn's intention is also to go further than just controlling the heating of your home. It will control heating, cooling, shading, ventilation,...



In search for an affordable way to visually control my home automation KNX installation using tablets and smart phones I came across the combination of SmartHome.py and SmartVisu. Very soon however I wanted to extend the functionality beyond their standard features to include Alarms, Permanent data monitoring and User permissions.
The current project adds plugins to SmartHome.py, and uses predefined a item structure to easily set things up. It also contains a visualisation with similar looks as SmartVisu but a very different set-up.

The goal of the project is to have an open source, user friendly control system for a domestic building, including a Model Predictive Control algorithm to control shading, heating and ventilation based on weather and energy price predictions should energy prices become variable in the near future.

 
The following steps will take you through the installation and configuration of KNXControl.
